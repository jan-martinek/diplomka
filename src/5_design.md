blaug - mezi kritickou a incumbent demokracií – vznik na okraji instituce (studenti) ale z centra a optimalizací procesu (senát) – "many innovations are designed with such empowement in mind" (smith, p. 3)

It appears to be a largely novel task to think about insti-tutional arrangements and procedures which could generate a selective pressure in favour of this type of reflective and open preference-learning, as opposed to fixed preferences that are entirely derivative from situational determinants, rigid beliefs or self-deception' (Offe and Preuss 1991: 168). (smith, 25)


First, in relation to the citizens who participate in the process, transparency requires that participants have a clear understanding about the conditions under which they are participating – for example, how has the issue under consideration been selected, who is organising the proc-ess, how will the outputs of the process affect political decisions? (smith, 25)

If institutions that engage citizens are to have a significant effect on pub-lic decisions, then the process needs to be open to scrutiny not only to the participants, but also to the wider public (unless of course the innova-tion engages all citizens). (smith, 25)

The organisers of ODPs suggest that there are a number of efficiency savings to be had by taking the innovation online. First, costs are reduced, although they remain expensive affairs. (smith, 158)

Compared to its highly expensive offline variant, online deliberative polling  is one example where there are potential cost savings, since participants (citizens, moderators and experts) do not have to be brought to a single geographical location, with the associated travel and subsistence costs. (smith, 180)

A number of influential theorists of deliberative democracy – for example, Jürgen Habermas and John Dryzek – have recognised the poten-tial tension between democratic deliberation and decision-making: their theories explicitly separate these two democratic moments. (smith, 196)



Highlight (yellow), 6. 4. 2013 0:30, Jan Martinek:
Institutions are not simply structures through which democratic goods are realised (although this remains important for instrumental theories of participation), but are also the medium through which democratic agency is expressed. Institutional design is integral to the form that democratic agency can take. (smith, 198-199)

Highlight (yellow), 6. 4. 2013 0:30, Jan Martinek:
Institutions within which a compelling combination of these goods are realised are likely to create conditions that foster and cultivate the moral and political education, reflexivity and empowerment that are fundamental to participatory theories of democracy (Warren 1996). (smith, 199)

Highlight (yellow), 6. 4. 2013 0:30, Jan Martinek:
Blaug's distinction suggests that any form of institutionalisation is disempowering in a democratic sense; but our analysis provides evidence to suggest that democratic innovations can at times be constitutive of the realisation of the kind of democratic agency that he wishes to celebrate. (smith, 199)
