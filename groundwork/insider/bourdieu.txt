Bourdieu, Pierre, 2003, Participant Objectivation, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 9, pp. 281â€“294.


Highlight (color #F7DC0A), Jan Martinek:
This does not mean that anthropologists must put nothing of them-selves into their work, quite the contrary.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
By 'participant objectivation', I mean the objectivation cf the subject cf objec-tivation, of the analysing subject - in short, of the researcher herself.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
it must also encompass the social conditions of the production of these pre-constructions and of the social agents who produce them.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
one does not have to choose between participant observation

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
and the objectivism of the 'gaze from afar'

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
Participant objectivation undertakes to explore not the 'lived ex-perience' of the knowing subject but the social conditions of possibility - and therefore the effects and limits - of that experience and, more precisely, of the act of objectivation itself


--- Page 3 ---

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
What needs to be objectivized, then, is not the anthropologist performing the anthropological analysis of a foreign world but the social world that has made both the anthropologist and the conscious or unconscious anthropol-ogy that she (or he) engages in her anthropological practice

our theoretical and methodological orientations, find their principle in socially constituted dispositions in which banally social, sadly impersonal properties still express themselves in a more-or-less transfigured form.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
The reflexivity fostered by participant objectivation

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
applies to the knowing subject the most brutaily objectivist tools that anthropology and sociology provide, in particular statistical analysis

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
o grasp everything that the thinking of the anthropologist (or sociologist) may owe to the fact that she (or he) is inserted in anational scientific field, with its traditions, habits of thought, problematics, shared commonplaces, and so on, and to the fact that she occupies in it a particular position (newcomer who has to prove herself versus consecrated master, etc.) , with 'interests' of a particular kind which unconsciously orientate her scientific choices (of discipline, method, object, etc.).

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
In short, scientific objectivation is not complete unless it includes the point of view of the objectivizer and the interests he may have in objectivation (especially when he objectivizes his own universe) but also the historical

unconscious that he inevitably engages in his work.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
turning anthropology against itself, as it were, and engaging the most remarkable theoretical and methodological discoveries of anthropology in the reflexive analysis of the anthropologists themselves. I have always regretted that those responsible for the most extra-ordinary advances of cognitive anthropology - I think of Durkheim and Mauss (1903) analysing 'primitive forms of classification' or of Levi-Strauss (1966) dismantling the workings of the 'savage mind' - never applied (with the partial exception of Durkheim's [1977] The evolution cf educational thought, and scat-tered programmatic remarks by Maurice Halbwachs) to their own universe some of the scientific insights that they provided about societies remote in space and time.

riflexive cognitive anthropology

I uncovered the unconscious classificatory schemata, or principles of vision and division, that French teacher

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
analogous to the forms of classification or the cognitive structures which

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
organize 'primitive' or 'savage' thought are also present, in just as unconscious astate, in scholarly thought, . so that, short of exercising special vigilance, anthropologists and sociologists themselves implement them in many of their everyday judgements

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
it enables us also to subject to constant critical vigilance all those 'first movements' (as the Stoics put it) of thought through which the unthought associated with an epoch, a society, a given state of a (national) anthropological field smuggle themselves into the work of thought, and against which warnings against ethnocentrism hardly give sufficient protection.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
The anthropologist who does not know himself, who does not have an adequate knowledge of his own primary experience of the world, puts the primitive at a distance because he does not recognize the primitive, pre-logical thought within himself.

Highlight (yellow), 9. 4. 2013 21:35, Jan Martinek:
It begins to become clear, or so I hope, that objectivation of the subject of objectivation is neither a mere narcissistic entertainment, nor a pure effect of some kind of wholly gratuitous epistemological point of honour, in that it exerts very real scientific effects. This is not only because it can lead one to discover all kinds of 'perversions' linked to the position occupied in scientific space, such as those spurious theoretical breaks, more-or-less conspicuously proclaimed, in which some young anthropologists eager to make a name for themselves indulge periodically (especially when they catch the latest strain of what my friend E.P. Thompson acerbically called 'the French flu'); or that kind of fossilization of research and even thought that can ensue from enclosure in a scholarly tradition perpetuated by the logic of academic reproduction. 

Highlight (yellow), 9. 4. 2013 21:35, Jan Martinek:
I am thinking in particular of what might be called 'Levy-Bruhl's mistake', which consists in creating an insurmountable distance between the anthropologist and those he takes as object, between his thought and 'primitive thought', for lack of having gained the necessary distance from his own native thought and practice by objectifying them.

Nothing is more false, in my view, than the maxim almost universally accepted in the social sciences according to which the researcher must put nothing of himself into his researc

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
What is more, they normally never ask themselves the questions that I would ask myself if I acted towards them as an anthropologist: Why such a ceremony? Why the candles? Why the cake? Why the presents? Why these invitations and these guests, and not others?

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
avoid putting into their heads, as it were, the problematic that I construct about them and the theory that I elaborate to answer it.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
Keeping firmly in mind the irreducible specificity of the logic of practice, we must avoid depriving ourselves of that quite irreplaceable scientific resource that is social experience previously subjected to sociological critique.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
the real object, partly hidden behind the dedared and visible object, was the subject of objectivation and even, to be more precise, the effects of knowledge of the objectivating posture, that is, the transformation undergone by the experience of the social world

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
when one ceases to 'live' it simply and instead takes it as object. 

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
methodical exercise in reflexivity was the starting-point for an endless to-and-fro between the reflexive phase of objectivation of primary experience and the active phase of investment of this experience thus objectified and criticized in acts of objec-tivation ever more remote from that experience

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
instead of'real' entities, clearly demarcated in reality and in ethnographic description, or genealogical sets defined on paper according to strictly genealogical criteria, they appeared to me as social constructions, more-or-less artificial artefacts, maintained by sustained exchanges and by a whole material and symbolic labour of 'group making' often delegated to women.

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
a whole set of rites of the academic tradition, which have the function and effect of giving the solemn sanction of the assembled collectivity to the new birth that the collectivity at once performs and demands - think of the 'commencement' and graduation ceremonies of British and American universities,

Highlight, Michael Toggweiler:
I believe that the researcher can and must mobilize his experience, that is, this past, in all his acts of research. But he is entitled to do so only on condition that he submits all these returns of the past to rigorous scientific examination.
