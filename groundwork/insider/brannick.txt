By insider research, we mean research by complete members of organizational systems and communities in and on their own organizations, in contrast to organizational research that is conducted by researchers who temporarily join the organization for the purposes and duration of the research (Adler & Adler, 1987).

Self-ethnography, as outlined by Alvesson (2003), is similar to our understanding of insider research:

A self-ethnography is a study and a text in which the researcher-author describes a cultural set-ting to which s/he has a “natural access,” is an active participant, more or less on equal terms with other participants. The researcher then works and/or lives in the setting and then uses the experiences, knowledge and access to empirical material for research purposes. (p. 174)

In our understanding of insider research, the research task is more formal, thought out, and planned than is the situation outlined by Alvesson, in which the research task is almost incidental.

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Insider researchers are native to the setting and so have insights from the lived experience. Rather than this being considered a benefit, insiders are perceived to be prone to charges of being too close, and thereby, not attaining the distance and objectivity deemed to be necessary for valid research. \citep[61]{brannic}

Bourdieu's notion of social praxeology, in which reflexivity and relational thinking are central, supports our focus on this neglected area (Everett, 2002) \citep[61]{brannic}

An objectivist view of epistemology accepts the possibility of a theory-neutral language; in other words, it is possible to access the external world objectively. A subjectivist view denies the possibility of theory-neutral language. An objectivist view of ontology assumes that social and natural reality have an independent existence before human cognition, whereas a subjectivist ontology assumes that what is taken as reality is an output of human cognitive process (Johnson & Duberley, 2000). \citep[63]{brannic}

Hermeneutic Tradition

The hermeneutic tradition understands social reality by interpreting the meanings held by the social actors or members of the social group. This involves entering into the culture, understanding shared values, speaking the culture's language, and so on. The researcher is an engaged participant whose critical and analytic observation of the culture is integral to the research activity \citep[65]{brannic}

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Theory (sometimes referred to as a symbolic system) is simply a way of abbreviating, of centering, of organizing, and of trying to make sense of experience rather than something to be constructed, deconstructed, tested, confirmed, disconfirmed, honored, or otherwise used to direct a study (Putnam et al., 1993). Thick description and narrative representation yield better insights than does research driven by theory and political implications. \citep[65]{brannic}

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Researchers are merely the interpreters between the community they describe and the audience to which they report their findings \citep[65]{brannic}

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Advocates of this approach will talk about such criteria as credibility, transfer-ability, dependability, and confirmability rather than reliability and validity (Stablein, 1996). \citep[65]{brannic}

Young was a complete member of his organization

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
As its intended outcomes are both an action and a theory outcome, action research does not recognize the distinction between academic and practitioner knowledge. According to principles of action research, the traditional split between research and action is, in many respects, a false distinction, and it typically is based on extreme views of what academic researchers are and what practitioners are. \citep[66]{brannic}

It focuses on a particular problem and seeks to provide assistance to the client system

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Data gathering does not occur only through the detached observational role but through the subjectively immersed role as well.

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Alvesson (2003) argues that observ-ing participant is a better term to use than participant observer. Participation comes first and only occasionally is complemented with observation in a research-focus sense. The opportunistic complete-membership role, as outlined by Adler and Adler, is closest to our idea of insider researchers. Complete memberships have an opportunity to acquire under-standing in use rather than reconstituted understanding.

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
The style of the then-current episte-mology was to suppress the membership role by analyzing the material from the outsider perspective and emphasizing detachment.

In con-trast, the reverse is true for insider researchers. They are already members of the organiza-tion and so have primary access. Although they have primary access, they may or may not have secondary access, that is, they may or may not have access to specific parts of the organization that are relevant to their research

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Clearly, any researcher's status in the organization has an impact on access. Access at one level auto-matically may lead to limits or access at other levels.

For those following a hermeneutic approach, insider research tends to be covert, as reported by Young (1991), whose ethnographic study of the police force of which he was a member was done surreptitiously as such study was considered by his peers to be espionage.

When insider researchers are interviewing, they may assume too much and so not probe as much as if they were out-siders or ignorant of the situation. They may think they know the answer and not expose their current thinking to alternative reframing. They may find it difficult to obtain relevant data because as a member, they have to cross departmental, functional, or hierarchical bound-aries, or because as an insider, they may be denied deeper access that might not be denied an outsider.

First, what is the potential for role conflict and value conflict when researchers study a familiar setting?

Note (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Leaving the setting may prevent such problems - in my case

If information was provided to her as a senior executive, she may have been authorized or even obliged to act on it to prevent harm to others. If it were provided to her as a researcher, she might not have the right to do so. Whatever the role, organizational members knew she was the same person and knew what they had told her and that she could not forget it.

This issue is handled differently in the different traditions. Positivists are expected to separate themselves via adhering to methodological principles of distance and objectivity and keep the two roles as distinct as possible. Hermeneutics researchers and postmodernist researchers are required to get as close as possible to their research sites, whereby there is little or no distinction between the two roles, and as action research is a collaborate, nego-tiated process, the two concurrent ongoing roles are constantly under review

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 21:01, Jan Martinek:
Undertaking a research project in one's own organization is political and might even be considered subversive.

We close with the words of Merton (1972, p. 44):

Insiders and outsiders in the domain of knowledge, unite. You have nothing to lose but your claims. You have a world of understanding to win.
