reflexive analysis of the implications of researching youth cultures from a point of initial subjective proximity is comparatively sparse

In some contexts Gillespie's local residence gave her a degree of insider status, while in others her ethnicity, her status as a teacher and, presumably, her age created barriers between herself and her respondents.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
significant degree of initial proximity between the sociocultural locations of researcher and researched

Furthermore, it would seem that the participants of such groups continue actively to differentiate themselves from those deemed not to share the characteristics or perspectives so important to them (Thornton 1995; Locher 1998; Pilkington 2004).

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
Importantly, while the nature and character of my personal involvement inevitably were affected by such academic activities, I continued to participate as an enthusiast as well as a researcher, something made easier, perhaps, by the aforementioned compatibility between the values of the goth scene and those of education and academia.

Yet such examples also demonstrate that non-insiders may have to work hard over a long period of time in order to gain the levels of trust they require (Brewer 2000, p. 61). Indeed, they may*/as in the cases of Humphreys and Fielding*/even have to deceive respondents through use of a covert approach.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
Those who merely ‘adopt' an unconventional appearance without possessing the necessary ‘inner' qualities are regarded . . . as ‘plastic' , ‘not real' . . . a subcultural ‘Other' against which the interviewees authenticate themselves. (Muggleton 2000

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
Alongside signifiers of age, ethnicity and class background that were compatible with those of most goths, my carefully cultivated subcultural appearance was critical in communicating my insider status to those present, as was my ability to participate authentically in activities such as dancing and making requests to the DJ.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
one's precise level of proximity is liable to fluctuate somewhat from one respondent to the nex

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
Nevertheless, the problem may be somewhat balanced by the simultaneous likelihood that, in the presence of someone they perceive as already ‘clued-up' , respondents may be discouraged from the worst excesses of conscious inaccuracy.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
It may be particularly easy for respondents to make exaggerations, omissions, guesses and throwaway statements in the presence of a relatively ignorant ‘professional stranger' and, for this reason, I found myself grateful to be perceived by my goth respondents as someone liable to identify obvious inaccuracies.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
Falling into the essentialist trap discussed earlier in this article, this uncompromis-ing position presents social groupings as fixed, one-dimensional and mutually exclusive (Merton 1972).

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
always be regarded as constructions rather than revelations

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
This is because, having experienced activities, motivations, feelings and affiliations that are liable, at least, to be comparable with those of many respondents, they have a significant extra pool of material with which to compare and contrast what they see and hear during the research process.

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
I also had taken part in conversations where, during moments of self-criticism, some participants had joked that the truest devotees to the goth scene could best be identified by their frantic denials of affiliation and assertions of individuality

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
In other words, rather than being regarded as a valuable additional resource, there is a danger that insider experience may start to become ‘an end in itself' (Bennett 2002), and, as such, a liability

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
In the case of youth cultures, there may be a danger that insider researchers are unable to disconnect themselves from group ideologies or that, as a result of a sense of loyalty, they begin to take on the role of what Bennett terms ‘subcultural spokesperson' , rather than that of critical analyst (Bennett 2003).

Highlight (yellow), 4. 5. 2013 23:11, Jan Martinek:
In the case of Roseneil's research on Greenham women, a gap of four years between her involvement with the protests and her research project is regarded by the author as having been essential to her ability to gain sufficient critical distance (1993, p. 192).

viewpoint fairly smoothly to shift from that of insider to that of insider researcher
