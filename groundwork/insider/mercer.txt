Merton (1972) identifies two opposing positions, one labelled the Outsider doctrine and the other labelled the Insider doctrine. The Outsider doctrine follows Simmel (1950) in asserting that only the neutral outsider can achieve an objective account of human interaction, because only he or she possesses the appropriate degree of distance and detachment from the subjects of the research. It is the stranger who is able „to survey conditions with less prejudice‟ (Simmel, 1950, p. 405), who can „stand back and abstract material from the research experience‟ (Burgess, 1984, p. 23), whilst it is the insider, overly-influenced by the customs of his or her group, who remains ignorant, parochially mistaking error for truth (Merton, 1972, p. 30).  By contrast, the Insider doctrine asserts the exact opposite, namely, that the outsider: has a structurally imposed incapacity to comprehend alien groups, statuses, cultures and societies … [because he or she] … has neither been socialized in the group nor has engaged in the run of experience that makes up its life, and therefore cannot have the direct, intuitive sensitivity that alone makes empathic understanding possible

Merton, himself, considers both doctrines to be fallacies, for the same reason he rejects the insider/outsider dichotomy.

On the one hand, greater familiarity can make insiders more likely to take things for granted, develop myopia, and assume their own perspective is far more widespread than it actually is; the vital significance of the „unmarked‟ (Brekhus, 1998) might not be noticed; the „obvious‟ question might not be asked  (Hockey, 1993, p. 206); the „sensitive‟ topic might not be raised (Preedy and Riches, 1988); shared prior experiences might not be explained (Powney and Watts, 1987, p. 186; Kanuha, 2000, p. 442); assumptions might not be challenged (Hockey, 1993, p. 202); seemingly shared norms might not be articulated (Platt, 1981, p. 82); and data might become thinner as a result.

To summarize the discussion so far, it would seem that definitions of insiderness and outsiderness influence the extent to which we conceive of them as dichotomous or continuous, and this, in turn, influences how far we value one position over the other. In other words, if we define insiderness as sharing a single ascribed status, such as gender, then we are likely to consider the two terms dichotomous, since one cannot be simultaneously both male and female. If, however, we view insiderness in a more pluralistic way (accepting that human beings cannot be classified according to a single ascribed status), then we are likely to consider the two terms as poles of a continuum that is more or less fluid, depending upon the way the end points are conceptualized

Whilst the outsider is „a man without a history‟ (Schutz, 1964, p. 34), the insider cannot escape his or her past \citep[15]{mercer}

Before I began my research, I took the view that little would be gained from presenting my findings to any group within either institution, and much might be lost, both personally and professionally, for researcher and informant alike. This continues to be my view, although now that I have moved thousands of miles from both institutions, I am a little less anxious about allowing the wider research community to

The researcher‟s relationship with the researched is not static, but fluctuates constantly, shifting back and forth along a continuum of possibilities, from one
