The paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the major theoretical concepts drawn upon in the article. Most importantly, we focus on the issues of commercialization and politicization in the subcultural scenes. Second, the concept of scene is discussed in particular detail. Third, we review our methodology.

The insider method was important for us because it offered significant ‘‘benefits in terms of practical issues such as access and rapport, at the same time. . .constituting an additional resource that may be utilized to enhance the quality of the eventual understandings produced.'' (Hodkinson, 2005: 136) However, we were aware of the possible difficulties of this research strategy lying in the ‘‘dual identity'' of researcher (Hodkinson, 2005); therefore, we did our best to balance carefully the ‘‘insider'' and ‘‘researcher'' elements. As only one of us received ‘‘insider status,'' we were better able to secure and reflect the benefits from both the initial proximity of the insider, and the necessary distance of the researcher.
