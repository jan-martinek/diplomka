The "insider/outsider" debate has been largely that, a debate. In line with the positivist tradition, the outsider perspective was considered optimal for its “objective” and “accurate” account of the field, while insiders, who possessed deeper insights about the people, place, and events, were believed to hold a biased position that complicated their ability to observe and interpret. However, scholars (Banks, 1998; Merton, 1978; Naples, 1996) have argued that the outsider-insider distinction is a false dichotomy since outsiders and insiders have to contend with similar methodological issues around positionality, a researcher's sense of self, and the situated knowledge she/he possesses as a result of her/his location in the social order1.

For an outsider, the danger is the imposition of the researcher's values, beliefs, and perceptions on the lives of participants, which may result in a positivistic representation and interpretation. For an insider bias may be overly positive or negligent if the knowledge, culture, and experience she/he shares with participants manifests as a rose-colored observational lens or blindness to the ordinary. These assumptions about insider positionality are theoretical, supported by little empirical evidence, and neglect the current trends of thinking in social construction and polyvocality. In truth, little insider research and a lack of development of an insider methodology have failed to systematically describe what insiders actually experience.

Theoretically, the insider positionality, the aspects of an insider researcher's self or identity which is aligned or shared with participants, has gone without definition, since to date no single articulation exists that describes what configuration or degree of social experience warrants the designation of insider.

…whereas all researchers necessarily reflect on their relationship to the research project, the native researcher is grounded implicitly and situated at all moments in the dual and mutual status of subject-object; she is both the subject of her study and the participant object of her study. (p. 441)

I found myself having difficulty focusing on the interview process and, more important on the responses and narratives of study respondents because of the distraction of my own self-reflections on similar events.

When members of an ingroup are present, individuals are likely to differentiate them based on “individuals or …subgroup representatives” from the ingroup: You are like me but with some differences. When outgroup members are present, they distinguish others based on in- and outgroup characteristics: You are more unlike me than like me.

Advantages to Insider Status

Positionality
• a nuanced perspective for observation,  interpretation  and representation
• an equalized relationship between researcher and participants
• expediency of rapport building 
• immediate legitimacy in the field
• economy to acclimating to the field            

Access
• expediency of access
• access to more in-group activities  

Data Collection/Interpretation/Representation
• insight into the linguistic, cognitive, emotional, sensory and psychological principles of participants 
• knowledge of the historical and practical  happenings of the field
• stimulation of natural interaction and  behavior 
• detection of participants' hidden behaviors and perceptions
• detection of nonverbal gestures of embarrassment and discomfort 
• detection of informants' actual behavior  versus their performed selves
• identification of unusual and unfamiliar  occurrences

Complications to Insider Status 

Positionality  
• Insider status unchecked can complicate or overwhelm researcher role.
• over-identification or over-reliance on status
• obscures researcher role or goal of research
• social roles in group or community constrain researcher role and objectives
• expectation to participant in community events or affairs
• overload with exchange or reciprocity requests from participants
• requests to take sides in community political and moral issues
• the rise of value conflicts as a result of research and community member role
• compromised professional ethics and/or research results
• participants' perceptions and expectations coopt researcher or constrain role  

Access 
• bias in entering field and establishing rapport 
• limited access based on political climate  

Data Collection/Interpretation/Representation 
• observer and/or participant role may be culturally inappropriate
• large amounts of impression management to  maintain rapport and/or identity
• selective reporting
• difficulty with recognizing patterns due to familiarity  with community
• bias in selecting participants
• breaking or maintaining relationships with  participants when leaving the field
• community interaction style compromises interview          process or observation
• insiderness obscures representation or  implementation due to turbulent or changing political  and historical climate of the field

While we are advantaged by the closeness afforded by the subject-object positionality, it dually complicated the implementation and completion of the research. Likewise, the shifting nature of our multiple identities revealed the fragility and complexity of our unique positionality. As a practical device, many insiders have consistently advocated for vigilant critical reflection on the effects of insiderness.
