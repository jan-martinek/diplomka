I argue that the insider/outsider dichotomy is simplistic, and the distinction is unlikely to adequately capture the role of all researchers. Instead, the role of the researcher is better conceptualised on a continuum, rather than as an either/ or dichotomy.

Highlight (yellow), 1. 4. 2013 16:34, Jan Martinek:
Despite emphasis on the differences between these supposedly diametrically opposed positions, and their underlying epistemologies, I considered myself to be neither an insider nor outsider in the context of my PhD research. I argue that the insider/outsider dichotomy is simplistic, and that neither term adequately captured the role I occupied throughout the research. To illustrate, I will discuss the role I played in my research, including the personal experiences that led me to consider myself to be neither inside nor outside the experience I was studying, and demonstrate how my role ‘in the middle' influenced my choice of research topic, the scope of my study, access to informants, the collection and analysis of data, and the maintenance of research rigor.
